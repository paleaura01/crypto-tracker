# MCP Server Availability Update

## Issue Found
The official `@modelcontextprotocol` servers are not yet published to npm registry, causing startup failures.

## Removed Non-Working Servers
- ❌ `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem` - Not published to npm
- ❌ `@modelcontextprotocol/server-git` - Not published to npm  
- ❌ `@modelcontextprotocol/server-sqlite` - Not published to npm
- ❌ `@modelcontextprotocol/server-time` - Not published to npm

## Current Working Configuration
Your MCP setup now includes only **verified working servers**:

### ✅ **Core Working Servers:**
- **Sequential Thinking** - `@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking` (0.6.2)
- **Playwright** - `@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server` (1.0.5)
- **Windows CLI** - `@simonb97/server-win-cli`
- **Basic Memory** - `basic-memory` (uvx)
- **Supabase** - `@supabase/mcp-server-supabase` (0.4.1)

### ✅ **Custom Local Servers:**
- **Fetch** - Your custom web content fetching
- **Solver** - Your Z3 constraint solving
- **Debug Shell** - Your debugging tools

## Alternative Solutions

### For File Operations
Instead of the missing `filesystem` server, you can:
- Use your existing **fetch** server for web content
- Use **Windows CLI** server for file operations
- Extend your **debug-shell** server with file operations

### For Version Control
Instead of the missing `git` server, you can:
- Use **Windows CLI** server to run git commands
- Use your **debug-shell** server for git operations

### For Database Operations
Instead of the missing `sqlite` server, you can:
- Continue using **Supabase** for database operations
- Use JSON files in `static/data/` directory
- Consider extending your custom servers

### For Time Operations
Instead of the missing `time` server, you can:
- Use JavaScript Date/Time operations in your app
- Add time utilities to your custom servers
- Use **Windows CLI** for date/time commands

## Future Monitoring
The official MCP servers will likely be published to npm in future releases. We can monitor:
- [MCP Servers Repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)
- npm registry for `@modelcontextprotocol/server-*` packages

## Current Status: Stable & Working
Your crypto-tracker MCP configuration is now stable with only verified, working servers. No more startup errors!
